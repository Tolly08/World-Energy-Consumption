The dataset contains the  World energy production capacity and energy consumption.The main purpose of this report is to have a better understanding of each country's energy capacity source

# To gather insight on how the each country's energy capacity, I generated the following insights
- Energy consumption by Countries for Coal, Wind, Gas, Hydro, Oil, Solar, Nuclear and Others.
- Energy production by countries for Oil, Gas and Coal.
- Population by Countries
- Electricity generation by Countries
- GDP by Country

# Steps taken to provide answers to the insight above
- Clean the dataset by replacicng blank cells with zero in power query.
- Close and apply and load to desktop. 
- Created Visuals and report.
-Designed my dashboard with the report and most important metrics.

# Summary
